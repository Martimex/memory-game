                Sometimes it is difficult to remember positions of the same icons.  What if colors would be another factor to care about ? This level will
                test your memoization and concentration skills. Being an insane difficulty, you have to try your best not to lose your focus, otherwise you'll
                end up burning limited turns and as a result, losing very quickly.

                This level was originally published in old-style version of Flash MG. It was created on September 20th, 2021 - being the seventh
                level released. 'Colorblind' is actually a level modified in almost any possible way. The old design was looking clunky, and a bit
                too simple gameplay mechanism (color switching icons) got completely updated. In terms of difficulty, the newer version
                helds more severe gameplay.
