                The power of darkness is trying to take over the world. It has to be prevented quickly! With the force of
                colorful fireflies by your side, conquer the darkness and any obstacle that comes through your way - even the
                time that is slowly running out.

                If you played some previous levels in the Serie, you've probably thought of them not being that difficult. Well, if
                that applies to you, then you should definitely try this one! Not only it is quite long, but also forces you to create a demanding
                memoization strategy to overcome the semi-invisible icons challenge. Don't give up too quick since that level might take
                you some time to complete.

                This level was originally published in old-style version of Flash MG. 'Lights' was created on September 12th, 2021 - being the fifth
                level released. Initially, 'Lights' was kept as a quick and simple challenge. However, after the redesign process, I found out that
                the mechanics have much more potential to make the gameplay more severe and thus satisfying on victory. So this is the final yet 
                far more difficult version!
