                What will happen if you find out, that there is a SECRET way straight to the hell ? Would you dare to enter ? It is said 
                a star is hidden somewhere in there, but who knows if that's the truth. After all, let's try to find it out, shall we ?

                Decent amount of levels in the game might store some secret paths to obtain some rewards, such as the stars. Unleashing the 
                secret might require extra steps to take in the level, or they simply can be an extra challenge to complete. Either way, you 
                will get rewarded if you manage to pass them.

            <span style={{fontWeight: 500, color: "hsla(50, 70%, 90%, .75)"}}>
                Here is a handy hint - the third star in this level can be obtained only when you unleash the secret path, and get two previous stars.
                Just avoid overusing turns and time you got - that should be more than enough.

                This level was originally published in old-style version of Flash MG. 'Stairs to hell' was created on August 30th, 2021 - being the fourth
                level released. The gameplay is very similiar to the initial version of the level - in fact, event the tile count is the exact same as it
                used to be. Only the design got modified, but just to some extent. Color scheme and background are still the same.
