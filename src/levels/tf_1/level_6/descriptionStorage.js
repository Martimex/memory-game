                It's all about the rotating board and keeping track of the tiles - simple enough, right ? Just do not underestimate the power of the spinning
                gameplay. It will be much trickier that you think - especially when you need to keep up with very limited time and turns count. That is the recipe
                for the nightmare!

                This is a primary example of a very challenging level that does not involve any complex mechanics rather than just a rotating board. It will definitely take you some decent amount of time to 
                get use to the spinning mechanic. Once you do, the level should become less and less tricky to beat.

                This level was originally published in old-style version of Flash MG. It was created on September 13th, 2021 - being the sixth
                level released. 'Spinning' was not modified too much since it release date. The gameplay and styling look actually very similiar.
                It just got slightly more decorated by adding those small spinning wheels on the left and right of the screen. Overall difficulty got
                increased to make it a very insane difficulty level.
