                The military commander is awaiting for you to help out with something mysterious. With what exactly? There are some rumors about a dangerous group,
                which is trying to spy recent military actions. Their intent is yet unknown. The commander will reward you every time you find a suspicious trace
                that may lead to catch the spying group. Listen out for his orders and be ready to satisfy them when the right opportunity appears.

                This level was originally published in old-style version of Flash MG. 'Camo' was created on October 4th, 2021 - being the eleventh
                level released. The original version kept the camo styling, so the new one does. The level mechaincs are pretty much the same as in the 
                initial release version, but some of design parts were slightly modified.
