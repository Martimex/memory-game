                Today's sunset was kind of different. The sky was crystal clear, with no clouds at all. A rainbow was seen at the horizont, even
                though it was not raining for weeks... A beautiful view got quickly interrupted by some heavy clouds. The omnipresent darkness appeared. 
                Now a sinister moon is looking at you in a mere silence. It is the only thing to guide you through the dark night. Follow him as long as you
                can and by all means do not let yourself fade into darkness.

                Welcome to the night adventure. To complete the level, collect some cooper, silver and golden shards present on the map. Please do be consistent here - as
                any notable sign of discordance is a dangerous step into the darkness. Do not fall into the trap even once and at the edge of the night, a shiny star is awaiting you.

                This level was originally published in old-style version of Flash MG. 'Nightscape' was created on October 14th, 2021 - being the thirteenth
                level released. The main concept around this level is still the same, nothing much changed in this regard. Desing got just slightly modified, since
                even the old version was very stable and nice looking. Only the tiles amount is significantly reduced here.
