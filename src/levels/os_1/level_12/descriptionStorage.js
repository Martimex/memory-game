                The map vision is not everlasting. You clearly cannot see the whole board forever... Well, you can, maybe at the beginning, but not any longer! Now it is on your
                duty to maintain the vision and to take advantage on what is revealed. Do not get too much confident, as every board piece you revealed may disappear at any
                moment.

                Rather than trying to remember the exact location of the tile while revealing, focus on which map side it is placed. This way, when you reveal corresponding tile icon,
                you will have an idea on where to look for the first one. This may help you especially in the late part of the game, as there will not be much tiles left, but you still have to spot 
                the right location of the respective pairs.

                This level was originally published in old-style version of Flash MG. 'Camo' was created on October 7th, 2021 - being the twelfth
                level released. This time modified parts were only about animations - the goal was to correct some of them, by slightly changing the colors and 
                glowing dots animation. The overall concept is the exact same.
