                Got bored of looking for tile pairs? Triples? Quads? Okay then, try this one. Prove your concentration skills with this mini challenge. Try to find as low as six combinations before
                time runs out. Prepare for the worst and hope for the best.

                Major amount of levels in the game is based on standard memory game rules. Simply put, for a single match, you need to combine two tiles. The number of tiles 
                required to form a match can be higher, but that is an obvious tradeoff for increased complexity. In theory there is no such limit as for combination cap,
                however when using increased combination count, a lesser amount of overall tiles should be considered. Otherwise, a seemingly simple level can become horrendous
                and absurd to conquer.
