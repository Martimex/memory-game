                Recent reports have proven that the air had been badly polluted by some chemicals. Everyone is suspecting that the origin of the problem lies in the old, 
                abandoned factory. Noone knows what exactly caused the pollution as there are no interest in exploring this place. However, since the radiation level is increasing
                day by day, there have been some real concerns about it. You have no choice but enter the factory - once you make the first step inside, there is no way out.

                The main principle to follow in this extreme level is not to repeat your actions. For curious, not abiding this simple yet strict rule will put you in a major disadvantage.  
                After all, if you have already revealed a tile, why would you reveal it again and again, right ?
