Descriptive walkthrough on how to create levels :

1. Head out to /global/all_levels.js file
	a) Inside appropiate serie abbreviation object, create a class instance (new Level) and fill
 	   it with properties. Make use of level 1 as an example.
	b) Keep in mind that each constructor property is a dynamic vakue with EXCEPTION of 
	   starting_animation field, which is associated with a SCRIPT named start.

2. Prepare necessary files
	a) First off, create a SVG image, which then would be stored inside /PUBLIC/bgs/{serie_name} 
	folder. 
	b) Go to /LEVELS folder, followed by /{serie_name} folder and add folder named level_{number}
	c) Inside this folder, prepare:
		I) [file] generatePlanItems.js - manages plan decorations and features
		II) [file] starConditions.js - handles star obtaining conditions regarding the level
		III) [folder] styles
		IV) [folder] scripts

	d) For STYLES, add following files:
		- main.css -> responsible for main tile layout
		- bg.css -> responsible for adding a background for level
		- firstPlan.css -> revolved around some stuff ongoing around the level first Plan
		- secondPlan.css -> revolved around some stuff ongoing around the level second Plan
		- *your bg SVG file* -> it will be included by bg.css file

	e) For SCRIPTS, add following files:
		- start.js -> contains all starting animations for each stage beginning
		- xclick.js -> animations for each click no. that is before match checking 
		- match.js -> responsible to correspond to finding / not finding a match
		- stagecomplete.js -> fires once player completes (or not) stage / level [AKA last stage]

3. Fill the files however you like. Also make sure to test level enough to prevent it from having 
   sone visual / gameplay bugs.
