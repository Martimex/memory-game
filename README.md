# Flash Memo Game

Test your memorizing skills with this crazy game. Awake your hidden memorizing potential by facing a series of challenging levels. Only the bravest Adventurers would make it through. Get rid of annoying tiles, find the right solutions and complete the epic Adventure through 20 levels. Would you dare to face them all?

## Story time

The idea of creating a memory game came spontaneously at the end of June 2021. During this time I was looking for picking a new framework to learn. I have chosen React. After few weeks of learning its basics, it turned out that combining memory game with a React app might be brilliant stuff. 

On July 13th I have created the repository and from on worked exclusively to create this project. The main template (landing page, main Game Component + bug resolving) was done in 1 month. After finishing the very basics, it was the high time to work on creating various levels. From early September to half of Dcember 2021 I was trying my best to design levels, which strongly differ from each ohter. Finally, on December 30th, the Flash Memo Game was deployed to production and from this day it is available to play.

During this time I have learnt a lot not only about React framework, but UX designing aswell. Thanks to this project, I feel way more comfortable creating various animations, making some cool SVGs, solving many new issues, and list goes on and on.

The project took approximately 400 - 450 hours to its initial release (including time to make those exhausing SVGs tho!). It might seem like a lot of the time for not that much complicated project, but I have spent quite a lot of the time on testing this game in order to be certain that it works OK.

## Prerequisites

No special requirements needed. However, I would highly recommend to play this game using mouse (instead of touchpads in laptops) for better in-game experience.\

## Tools used

Here is the brief list of tools used to create this App:

- ReactJS [framework]; 
- NodeJS [runtime environment]; 
- Font Awesome [for all that fancy icons in the game]; 
- Anime.js [animation library - 99% of animations were made thanks to it]; 
- Inkscape [tool for making SVG's];
- Heroku [hosting provider];

## Future improvements

A lot of improvements have already been done in this project, but there's a lot more still unfinished. Following is the current todo list (in order from the most important):

1. Make a version accessible for mobile devices;
2. Create a pause button for levels (especially useful for time based levels);
3. A bit of work around levels balancing stuff;
4. Minor bugs resolving;
